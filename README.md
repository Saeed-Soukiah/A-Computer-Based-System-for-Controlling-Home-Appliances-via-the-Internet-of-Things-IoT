# A-Computer-Based-System-for-Controlling-Home-Appliances-Via-Internet-Of-Things-IoT

## Project Idea
A general embedded system model designed to control, automate, and monitor a home, store, or institution wirelessly through the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system uses a set of sensors and electronic modules controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, with IoT functionality implemented using the ESP-8266 module. The integration mechanism between the Arduino and ESP-8266 is explained in detail in the project documentation.
